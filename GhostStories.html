  <h3><strong>Evil Or Not </strong></h3>
  <br>My story has started since I moved into my house, around 8 years ago.</br> 
  <br>The house I lived in previously belonged to an old woman, whose family lived in the street as well. </br> 
<br>Sadly she passed away, and we bought the house. </br>
<br>This is important, because I thought the ghost could be her. </br> 
<br>We changed the layout of the house, and re-decorated it all, so this might have angered her ghost. </br>

<br> But this can't be her. The ghost I know haunts me, is definitely a male presence, a young adult perhaps. I have felt this presence since we moved in, and have always felt like I'm being watched in my house. </br>

<br>Not out and about, just in my house. It's like having a person that follows me everywhere. </br> <br>I have felt this presence more so this past year as I have gone through more medical struggles, being diagnosed with chronic fatigue, and slowly overcoming this. </br>

<br>I was hoping for peoples adivce, I only ever have a visual presence of this ghost in the dark, and it's like a blurred picture. It feels like an itch when I am aware he is close. </br>

<h3><strong>Man In The Shower</strong></h3
<br>My sister and I were awake on the weekend watching cartoons in the living room. </br> <br>It was an episode of Spongebob. </br> <br>Our parents were asleep since they had to work tomorrow. <br>It was late at night. I believe around 1am or 2am I'm not too sure.</br> <br>My sister and I would try and stay up for as long as we could on the weekends. </br> <br>Just a couple of little innocent kids enjoying our weekend from school.</br>

<br>My sister and I were in that stage where if one of us were too scared to sleep in our own beds, we would sneak past our parent's room and sleep in the other's room. My mom hated it. </br> <br>I was always afraid of the dark. </br> <br>We were the type of siblings that did everything together. When one had to use the restroom in the middle of the night, the other would stand outside the door in the dark to be the 'lookout'. </br> <br>Covered our faces if we got scared in bed. Typical kid stuff. </br>

<br>So, that being out of the way, my sister wanted to use the restroom before bed. </br> <br>One of our favorite things to do as kids... Piggy back rides in the dark. I don't know why. Kid stuff. </br> <br>I would always give her piggy back rides in pitch black darkness. She would always hold her hands out in front of my face so that I wouldn't run into anything. We were the ultimate team together. </br>

<br>This specific night, I turned off the television and had her hop on my back and we made our way in the dark to the restroom. </br> <br>As kids, our eyes adjusted to the darkness fairly easily. We could make out the shadows of objects.</br> <br>There were still times where the dark got the best of me and I would still run into things but, only rarely.</br> <br>Once we made it to the restroom, I froze. I was terrified. Not me or my sister could move. </br>

<br>As I stood in the doorway of the restroom, there was a figure of a man. </br> <br>It was only a shadow. </br> <br>He was at the far end of the shower. He was sticking his head and torso out with his arm fully extended outwards towards the wall across from the shower.</br> <br>The shadow was doing this repeatedly. Keeping the same exact position. Going behind the shower curtain, and coming back out, back in, out. </br>

<br>I was too afraid to turn on the light. I was afraid of what this man REALLY looked like. </br> I remember imagining a bloody faced naked man in our bathroom so, I didn't dare turn on that light. I knew my sister could see it too. She whispered,

"You see it too right?"

She sounded like she was about to cry. I remember almost crying myself. This thing just kept doing whatever it was doing for as long as we stared at it. The longer it did it, the more freaked out we got. We didn't know what to do. We were afraid.

Just when we couldn't take it anymore, I stepped out of the doorway and started shouting for my mother without taking my eyes off of it. My sister did the same. She always had a specific screech that always sent my mother running in her direction within seconds but, this time, she was taking longer...

The moment we started shouting, the person stopped what he was doing and stayed retreated inside the shower. This sent me and my sister into sheer panic. I remember screaming and screaming for my mother. For once, I screamed over my sister. My mom tumbled her way through the dark towards us and held us both in her arms frantically asking us what was going on and of course we were trying to tell her that there was a man in the shower.

She turned on the bathroom light and swiped the shower curtain open and of course, the man wasn't there.
