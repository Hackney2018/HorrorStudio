  <h3><strong>Evil Or Not</strong></h3>
  <brMy story has started since I moved into my house, around 8 years ago.</br> 
  <br>The house I lived in previously belonged to an old woman, whose family lived in the street as well. </br> 
<br>Sadly she passed away, and we bought the house. </br>
<br>This is important, because I thought the ghost could be her. </br> 
<br>We changed the layout of the house, and re-decorated it all, so this might have angered her ghost. </br>

<br> But this can't be her. The ghost I know haunts me, is definitely a male presence, a young adult perhaps. I have felt this presence since we moved in, and have always felt like I'm being watched in my house. </br>

<br>Not out and about, just in my house. It's like having a person that follows me everywhere. </br> <br>I have felt this presence more so this past year as I have gone through more medical struggles, being diagnosed with chronic fatigue, and slowly overcoming this. </br>

<br>I was hoping for peoples adivce, I only ever have a visual presence of this ghost in the dark, and it's like a blurred picture. It feels like an itch when I am aware he is close. </br>
