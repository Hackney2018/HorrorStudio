<strong>Evil Or Not</strong>
 <br><strong>My story has started since I moved into my house, around 8 years ago.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>The house I lived in previously belonged to an old woman, whose family lived in the street as well.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>Sadly she passed away, and we bought the house.</strong></br>
<br><strong>This is important, because I thought the ghost could be her.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>We changed the layout of the house, and re-decorated it all, so this might have angered her ghost.</strong></br>
<br><strong>But this can't be her. The ghost I know haunts me, is definitely a male presence, a young adult perhaps. I have felt this presence since we moved in, and have always felt like I'm being watched in my house.</strong></br>
<br><strong>Not out and about, just in my house. It's like having a person that follows me everywhere.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>I have felt this presence more so this past year as I have gone through more medical struggles, being diagnosed with chronic fatigue, and slowly overcoming this.</strong></br>
<br><strong>I was hoping for peoples adivce, I only ever have a visual presence of this ghost in the dark, and it's like a blurred picture. It feels like an itch when I am aware he is close.</strong></br>

<strong>Man In The Shower</strong>
<br><strong>My sister and I were awake on the weekend watching cartoons in the living room.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>It was an episode of Spongebob. </br> Our parents were asleep since they had to work tomorrow.</strong></br>
<br><strong>It was late at night. I believe around 1am or 2am I'm not too sure.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>My sister and I would try and stay up for as long as we could on the weekends.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>Just a couple of little innocent kids enjoying our weekend from school.</strong></br>
<br><strong>My sister and I were in that stage where if one of us were too scared to sleep in our own beds, we would sneak past our parent's room and sleep in the other's room. My mom hated it.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>I was always afraid of the dark. </br> 
<br><strong>We were the type of siblings that did everything together. When one had to use the restroom in the middle of the night, the other would stand outside the door in the dark to be the 'lookout'.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>Covered our faces if we got scared in bed. Typical kid stuff.</strong></br>
<br><strong>So, that being out of the way, my sister wanted to use the restroom before bed.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>One of our favorite things to do as kids... Piggy back rides in the dark. I don't know why. Kid stuff.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>I would always give her piggy back rides in pitch black darkness. She would always hold her hands out in front of my face so that I wouldn't run into anything. We were the ultimate team together.</strong></br>
<br><strong>This specific night, I turned off the television and had her hop on my back and we made our way in the dark to the restroom.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>As kids, our eyes adjusted to the darkness fairly easily. We could make out the shadows of objects.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>There were still times where the dark got the best of me and I would still run into things but, only rarely.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>Once we made it to the restroom, I froze. I was terrified. Not me or my sister could move.</strong></br>
<br><strong>As I stood in the doorway of the restroom, there was a figure of a man.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>It was only a shadow. </br> 
<br><strong>He was at the far end of the shower. He was sticking his head and torso out with his arm fully extended outwards towards the wall across from the shower.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>The shadow was doing this repeatedly. Keeping the same exact position. Going behind the shower curtain, and coming back out, back in, out.
I was too afraid to turn on the light. I was afraid of what this man REALLY looked like.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>I remember imagining a bloody faced naked man in our bathroom so, I didn't dare turn on that light. I knew my sister could see it too. She whispered,"You see it too right?"</strong></br>

<br><strong>She sounded like she was about to cry. I remember almost crying myself. This thing just kept doing whatever it was doing for as long as we stared at it. The longer it did it, the more freaked out we got. We didn't know what to do. We were afraid.</strong></br>

<br><strong>Just when we couldn't take it anymore, I stepped out of the doorway and started shouting for my mother without taking my eyes off of it. My sister did the same. She always had a specific screech that always sent my mother running in her direction within seconds but, this time, she was taking longer...</strong></br>

<br><strong>The moment we started shouting, the person stopped what he was doing and stayed retreated inside the shower. This sent me and my sister into sheer panic.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>I remember screaming and screaming for my mother. For once, I screamed over my sister. </br> 
<br><strong>My mom tumbled her way through the dark towards us and held us both in her arms frantically asking us what was going on and of course we were trying to tell her that there was a man in the shower.</strong></br>

<br><strong>She turned on the bathroom light and swiped the shower curtain open and of course, the man wasn't there.</strong></br>

<strong>Soldiers Or Nurses?</strong>
<br><strong>I've always been open minded regarding ghosts, having not had many experiences myself, but family members have had some truly terrifying things happen to them and I believe their accounts!</strong></br>

<br><strong>I'd lived in the same house all of my life until renting my first flat just over two years ago.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>It was a huge old building, with the look of a Tudor Manor House, but was originally a military war hospital during WW1.</strong></br>

<br><strong>I fell in love with the huge windows and high ceilings and moved in, living alone for the first time at the age of 23.</strong></br>

<br><strong>The first time I walked in on my own I noticed how NOT alone I felt. Up until then someone else had always been with me, helping me move. But now, on my own, I couldn't help but feel as though someone else was in the flat with me.</strong></br>

<br><strong>It didn't feel uncomfortable or negative. It was truly as though I'd walked into someone's house and they were still home.</strong></br>

<br><strong>It didn't bother me. The first few nights were normal and I adjusted to living alone - coming from a big family, I wonder if feeling as though I wasn't alone actually made it easier for me to live alone, if that makes sense?</strong></br>

<br><strong>One day I left the flat, closing my bedroom door as was always my habit at the family home, and returned some hours later.</strong></br> 
<br>Pushing open my bedroom door, I was surprised to find pairs of my shoes lined up against the other side of the door, bunched up from where I'd pushed the door open against them.</strong></br>

<br><strong>I stared at them for a while. I couldn't have lined my shoes up against the door and then left through the doorway without disturbing them.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>There was no other entrance to the room, and no one except my landlord had keys to the flat.</br> 
<br><strong>Even so, no one could have lined up my shoes against the door and got out of the room without having the door push the shoes up against the wall.</strong></br>

<br><strong>I was confused, but still no bad feelings.</strong></br>

<br><strong>As the days passed I slowly unpacked my belongings, made slower by having to go work every day.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>A few times I'd open drawers that I knew to be empty and find my stuff already in them.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>Various bits and pieces would be in cabinets and drawers that I knew I hadn't put there.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>I even asked the family members that had helped me move, and they all assured me that they hadn't taken anything out of the boxes and bags they moved in.</strong></br>

<br><strong>On a few occasions, late at night, I would be in bed trying to sleep and I'd hear noises in the kitchen.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>My bedroom was next to the kitchen, and the walls of the flat were very thick and I never heard my neighbours at night, so I was sure it was from my kitchen.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>I'd hear knocks and shuffling, but nothing would be disturbed in the morning.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>I was way too much of a chicken to check the noises out there and then.</strong></br>

<br><strong>One of the more distinct noises sounded like plastic rattling.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>I had a set of plastic measuring cups hanging from a cupboard handle in the kitchen, and one day after the noises I knocked the cups against each other to see what it sounded like.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>It was the exact same sound I'd heard at night.</strong></br>

<br><strong>These aren't scary experiences but I think they're interesting, together with the feeling that I was never truly alone.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>I'd hear knocks on various doors and other noises but as I lived on the top floor with one neighbour beside me, I could never be sure that it wasn't someone else in the block.</strong></br>

<br><strong>My friends commented after I'd moved out that they'd always felt as though I was in someone else's flat, rather than it being mine.</strong></br>

<br><strong>I no longer live in that building, but think of it often.</strong></br> 
<br><strong>I wonder if what I experienced was some kind of residual energy of the nurses and soldiers tidying up and going about their business as though it was still a military war hospital.</strong></br>

<br><strong>I enjoyed my time there but wasn't sorry to leave it.</strong></br> 
<br>It felt as though I was leaving hospital myself, and I was relieved and happy to see the back of it.</strong></br>
