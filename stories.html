	<strong>Creepy Pasta:</strong>
	<br></br>
	<strong> My Baby</strong>
<br>My husband and I were laying in bed one night when we heard a noise. Nothing crazy, just a small rustling noise.</br> 
<br>We argued over who should check it out, decided it was nothing and then tried to go back to sleep.</br>
<br>Heard the noise again. What the heck? “You go!” “No, YOU go!”</br>
<br>While we were arguing we heard it again near the foot of our bed.</br> 
<br>I turned on my phone to use as a light and saw my daughter on the floor.</br>
<br>She was on all fours, cocked her head, turned her face toward the light at a most disturbing angle,
and then  skittered on all fours back into her room and into her bed.</br>
<br>My husband and I were absolutely horrified/terrified.</br>
