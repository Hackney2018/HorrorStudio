    <h1>About Us</h1>	
	 <p>Here you will be able to read about the background of the "Horror Studio" developers.</p> 
	 <p>We both are seniors of Whitehall High School.</p> 
	 <p>We decided to work on a project where people could read spooky stories of many genre types.</p>
	  <h1>Caden</h1>
	 <p> I have taken a couple technology classes at Whitehall High School and have been interested in programming for quite a while and is what I am currently aiming towards.</p>
	 <p> I love playing many varieties of games. One of my personal favorites is FPS (First Person Shooters).</p>
	 <p> First Person Shooters are games that are Player vs player and where you must complete objectives while simultaneously killing people to defend yourself and your team.</P>
	 <p> There are so many FPS games, such as Call Of Duty, Battlefield, Grand Theft Auto, and so many more.</p>
         <p> Gaming and programming are two of my favorite things to do, and that is why I am aiming for a degree into the programming field.</p>
         <p></p> 
	   <h1>Trevor</h1>
		<p> Ever Since I was a kid I always wanted to be a Marine Biologist.</p>
		<p> After being diagnosed with Asthma I knew that being a Marine Biologist Would no longer be as easy.</p>
		<p> I could still have been in the Marine Biologist field but I would not have been able to do what I wanted in that field.</p>
		<p> I always wanted to go under the water and study the sea floor. Studying sharks and other creatures alike was always my dream. </p>
	        <p> When we got the news I didn't even know what I wanted to do next.</p>
	        <p> I tried Video Game Design and I did not perfer that field. Now I am studying Cyber Security.</p>
		<p> Even though my mind was set on Marine Biology for a long time, I felt like Cyber Security was always something I was interested in.</p>
		<p> I attented the Career Tech Center in Muskegon, Michigan in 2016-2018 and earned two Microsoft Certifications in Security and Networking.</p>
		<p> After High School I plan on attending MCC for 2 year and working on CompTIA Certifications, then transferring to Ferris and finishing my degree in Cyber Security or programming.</p>
	        <p>I also am working on another webiste for personal/business use. You will be able to read about many things like my future career, Certifications, and Education.<a href="https://hackney2018.github.io/Life-Story/"><span style="color:#00FFFF">   My Personal Website(click)</a></span></p>
