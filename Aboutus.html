<p><strong>Here you will be able to read about the background of the "Horror Studio" developers.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>We both are seniors of Whitehall High School.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We decided to work on a project where people could read spooky stories of many genre types.</strong></p>
<h1><strong>Caden</strong></h1>
<p> <strong>I have taken a couple technology classes at Whitehall High School and have been interested in programming for quite a while and is what I am currently aiming towards.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>I love playing many varieties of games. One of my personal favorites is FPS (First Person Shooters).</strong></p>
<p> <strong>First Person Shooters are games that are Player vs player and where you must complete objectives while simultaneously killing people to defend yourself and your team.</strong></p>
<p> There are so many FPS games, such as Call Of Duty, Battlefield, halo, and so many more.</p>
<p> <strong>Gaming and programming are two of my favorite things to do, and that is why I am aiming for a degree into the programming field.</strong></p>
<p></p> 
<h1><strong>Trevor</strong></h1>
<p> <strong>Ever Since I was a kid I always wanted to be a Marine Biologist.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>After being diagnosed with Asthma I knew that being a Marine Biologist Would no longer be as easy.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>I could still have been in the Marine Biologist field but I would not have been able to do what I wanted in that field.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>wanted to go under the water and study the sea floor. Studying sharks and other creatures alike was always my dream.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>got the news I didn't even know what I wanted to do next.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Video Game Design and I did not perfer that field. Now I am studying Cyber Security.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Even though my mind was set on Marine Biology for a long time, I felt like Cyber Security was always something I was interested in.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>I attented the Career Tech Center in Muskegon, Michigan in 2016-2018 and earned two Microsoft Certifications in Security and Networking.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>After High School I plan on attending MCC for 2 year and working on CompTIA Certifications, then transferring to Ferris and finishing my degree in Cyber Security or programming.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I also am working on another webiste for personal/business use. You will be able to read about many things like my future career, Certifications, and Education.</strong> <a href="https://hackney2018.github.io/Life-Story/"><span style="color:black"><strong>My Personal Website (click)</strong></a></span></p>
